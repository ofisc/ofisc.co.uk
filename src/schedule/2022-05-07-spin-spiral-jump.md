A Spin Spiral Jump event is taking place at 4pm on 07 May 2022 at the Oxford Ice Rink.

Appropriate music for each skater will be set by the team on the day.

There is no minimum level for the Spin Spiral Jump event but you will need your own skates and you will need a private coach to help you put a routine together.

Contact your coach for entry forms, entries close on 30 April 2022. Payment is to be made with the entry form to your coach.
