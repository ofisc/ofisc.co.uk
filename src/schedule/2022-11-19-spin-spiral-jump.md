Figure Club is holding a Spin Spiral Jump competition from 4:30pm until 6pm on Saturday 19 November at the Oxford Ice Rink.

This is a fun and easy competition that provides a gentle introduction to figure skating as a performance sport.

Appropriate music for each skater will be set by the team on the day.

It will be judged by a panel, so that skaters get the feeling of how a competition runs. There will also be a prize ceremony at the end, which the jduges feed into. But it's all very friendly, so don't be put off by skating in front of judges.

There is no minimum level for the Spin Spiral Jump competition but you will need your own skates and you will need a private coach to help you put a routine together. This will not require a huge amount of private coaching, it is simply to provide the skater with some orientation before they take the ice on the day.

Entry forms, closing dates and cost have not yet been decided. When this is finalized, this announcement will be updated accordingly and anybody who has regsitered interest will be notified.

We're announcing this as early as possible to give skaters who do not currently have a coach an opportunity to reach out to coaches and prepare in time for the event.
