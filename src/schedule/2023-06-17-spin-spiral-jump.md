Figure Club is holding a Spin Spiral Jump competition from 4:30pm until 7pm on Saturday 17 June at the Oxford Ice Rink.

This is a fun and easy competition that provides a gentle introduction to figure skating as a performance sport.

Appropriate music for each skater in the Spin Spiral Jump will be set by the team on the day.

## Competition Categories

There are two categories for the competition:

* Spin Spiral Jump - aimed at first time competitors who have not practiced their own routine. We will supply music for you to skate to.
* Beginner - aimed at skaters who have passed Skate UK Gold but have not completed Beginner level and have practised their own routine. You will need to bring a CD with your music to the competition.

## Judging

The event will be judged by a panel, so that skaters get the feeling of how a competition runs. There will also be a prize ceremony at the end, which the jduges feed into. But it's all very friendly, so don't be put off by skating in front of judges.

### Spin Spiral Jump Category

There is no minimum level for the Spin Spiral Jump competition but you will need your own skates and you will need a private coach to help you put a routine together. This will not require a huge amount of private coaching, it is simply to provide the skater with some orientation before they take the ice on the day.

### Programme Category

The programme category will be judged professionally which means you can use your score as a feedback leading up to official competitions.

## Entry Fee

The entry fee depends on which category you enter: 

* The Spin, Spiral Jump category the entry is £15
* The programme category is £20
