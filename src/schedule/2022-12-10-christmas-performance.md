There is going to be a Oxford Ice Rink Christmas show featuring performances from Skate Academy, Dance Club and Figure Club.

The dates have not yet been confirmed, but we want to give you as much notice as possible.

The tentative dates are

Saturday 10th December (approx 18:00-20:00)
Sunday 11th December (approx 14:30-16:30)

And for all participating skaters there is also a mandatory dress rehearsal on

Saturday 3rd December (approx 16:30)

We’re working with Oxford School of Skating to try to firm up Figure Club’s involvement in the event.

Hopefully this can fit into everybody’s busy December diary!
