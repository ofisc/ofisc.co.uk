Figure Club will conduct a improvisation event on Friday 27/05/2022 during the normal club ice time from 5:30-6:30pm.

The improvisation is an internal event for OFISC members only. This is a fun event that allows each skater to put their skills into a routine. The music to skate to will be a surprise and no routines will be practiced beforehand. Because of this, nobody will have an advantage over anybody else.

This is a fantastic opportunity to have the whole rink to yourself, and it will be a whole lot of fun!

## How It Works

* Depending on the numbers of participants, the coaches decide if skaters work on this solo or in teams of 2
* The coaches will choose 4 separate tracks each lasting 1 minute 30 seconds (may be adjusted subject to final numbers)
* There are 4 separate rooms each with one of the tracks to be played
* There will be numbers 1 to 4 in a pot
* Skaters pick out a number and that will determine which piece of music they get and which room on the day they would go into
* Each group listens to their track on repeat for 10 minutes
* During this 10 minutes, each skater will come up with a routine that they will skate to
* (TBC) Skaters warm up for x minutes
* Each skater skates their routine
* A panel of three judges observe and mark each routine and results given after everyone has skated
* Usually the skaters would stay in their room until they have skated. Obviously the idea being that they wouldnâ€™t be able to copy each other
* Once skated, any skater can watch the rest of the program


## Judging

There is a panel of three judges who will mark each routine. After everybody has skated a presentation ceremony will take place to announce the winner.
