title: "OFISC Photography and Video Policy"
version: "2023-11-04"
---
 
This policy is intended to provide information to club members and their parents/carers about how photographs and videos are recorded, stored and used by OFISC.
 
Certain uses of photographs and videos are necessary for the ordinary running of the club, while other uses are in the legitimate interests of the club and its community.
 
As part of OFISCâ€™s activities, we may take photographs and record videos of club members. We will obtain written consent from parents/carers for photographs and videos to be taken of their child for the purposes of communication, administration and safeguarding, and for promotional materials. Parents/carers who accept a place at the club for their child will be required to indicate whether they agree to OFISC using photographs and videos as set out in this policy. However, parents/carers should be aware that certain uses (i.e. for administrative purposes) may be necessary or unavoidable.
 
Uses may include:

* Club administrative resources
* Club promotional materials such as magazines, brochures, newsletters etc.
* Online on the OFISC website or social media pages
 
When using photographs and videos in promotional materials or online, they will not be accompanied with any personal information about the child except for their first name, so that they cannot be identified. 
 
Photographs and videos posted on social media will not be stored. Selected images for future promotional and communication activities will be kept in a dedicated and secure GDPR-compliant data storage facility.
 
Consent for photographs and videos to be used can be withdrawn at any time by emailing club@ofisc.co.uk.
 
Parents/carers should be aware that from around the age of 12 upwards, the law recognises that children have their own rights to have a say in how their personal information is used, including photographs and videos. A child may want to exercise rights over this area, but as a club we will typically act on parent/carer directives.
 
Parents/carers are asked to be mindful of the spirit of this policy when taking group photos and videos, and are reminded that such images are for personal use only.
