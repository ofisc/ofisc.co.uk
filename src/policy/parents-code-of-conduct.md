## Purpose

Parents should be encouraged to accompany their children to activities, but they should not be included in supervision calculations unless they are present in an official volunteering role.

NISA Parents’ Code of Ethics give everyone a guide to what is expected of parents if they are part of an organisation, participating in a sport, or are spectators at their child’s events. Ethics in sport are embodied in the following principles:

* respect
* responsibility
* fairness
* caring
* trustworthiness
* good citizenship

## Guidelines

The NISA Parents Code of Ethics asks the parents to respect the following guidelines:

1. Encourage your child to skate in a safe and healthy environment.

2. Encourage good sportsmanship by demonstrating positive support for all skaters, coaches, volunteers and officials and do not question the judgement of event officials

3. Emphasise that doing one’s best is more important than winning. Teach that effort and participation are important as victory

4. Do your best to make skating fun and remember that the child participates in sports for his/her own enjoyment – not yours. Do not force them to participant unwillingly

5. Advise your child to treat other skaters, coaches and officials with respect

6. Advise your child to treat everyone equally and sensitively regardless of their age, disability, gender, race, ethnic origin, cultural background, sexual orientation, religious, beliefs or political affiliation

7. Inform your child’s coach of any physical disability that may affect the safety of the child or the safety of others.

8. Place the emotional and physical well-being of your child ahead of your personal desire to win.

9. Support all efforts to remove verbal, physical and racist abuse from ice skating

10. Remember that young people and vulnerable adults learn best by example

## Rights of Parents and Carers

As a parent/carer you have the right to:

* Be assured that your child is safeguarded during their participation in sport
* Be informed of problems or concerns relating to your children
* Be informed if your child is injured
* Have your consent sought for participation in event, trips and competition
* Have your consent sought for participation in film or photography
* Contribute to decisions within the Club
* Have any concerns about any aspect of your child’s welfare listened to responded to

## Expectations of Parents and Carers

As parents, you are expected to:

* Complete and return the Registration, Medical and Consent Form pertaining to your child's participation with the Club
* Be responsible for ensuring your child arrives and is collected punctually before and after sessions/competitions/events
* Detail any relevant medical concerns or conditions pertaining to their child on the registration/consent form. Any changes in the state of the child's health should be reported to the coach or Club staff prior to the activity
* Encourage your child to play by the rules, and teach them that they can only do their best
* Ensure that your child understands their code of conduct
* Behave responsibly whilst spectating; do not embarrass your child
* Show appreciation and support the coach
* Be realistic and supportive
* Accept the decisions of coaches, judges and other officials

## Adherance to the Code of Conduct

Any breaches of this code of conduct will be dealt with immediately by a Designated Person.

Persistent concerns or breaches may result in you being asked not to attend training sessions, competitions or any other event organised by the club if your attendance is considered detrimental to the welfare of young participants.

The ultimate action should a parent/carer continue to breach the code of behaviour may be the Club regrettably asking your child to leave the session, event or Club.
