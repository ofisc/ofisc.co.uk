* During coaching sessions you are expected to adhere to the coachesâ€™ instructions and you will be asked to leave the ice if you do not co-operate

* Be courteous on the ice by giving way to skaters who are being coached and skaters who are skating to their music

* When talking at the ice edge please remain aware of members who are skating and be prepared to move or leave the ice

* There is a queuing system for playing music. Ask if you are unsure

* MP3 players/ipods and headphones are not allowed on the ice

* Behave appropriately at all times by observing the rules of the ice rink, which are displayed around the rink side

* Wear appropriate training clothes when on the ice, such as tracksuit bottoms/leggings, skating tights and skating dresses

* Ensure long hair is tied back
