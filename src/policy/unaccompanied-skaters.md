## Travelling to/from the ice rink without a parent/guardian

All children aged 10 or below must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Children aged 11 or above may go home on their own only if the parent/guardian has given written consent by completing the form below. This is kept in the register of children with consent to leave the OFISC alone. Please immediately notify us of any changes in circumstances.

Parents must be aware that they are responsible for their childâ€™s safety on their way from the ice rink even when they are not physically present.

Persons with parental responsibility must complete the [Unaccompanied Consent form][unaccompanied-consent-form]
