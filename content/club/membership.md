The 3 week trial is free, but we do require you fill out the membership form so that we have your details on file prior to getting on the ice.

Once a skater has completed their 3 week trial, should they enjoy the club, we would ask them to become a permanent member. Should you decide to join, we request you set up the direct debit to cover membership fees.

## Cost

Membership from March 2023 costs £38 per month, this covers rink and coach expenses. The club runs most Friday's throughout the year, except Easter and Christmas. Siblings receive a 10% discount.

## Payment

Membership fees are due on a monthly rolling basis. When you join, we ask for you to set up a direct debit mandate that will be used to collect the membership fee each month.

The direct debit is managed on behalf of the club by [GoCardless][]. You are protected by the [Direct Debit Guarantee][dd_guarantee]. Payment details are collected securely by GoCardless and they are not shared with the club.

Once you have setup up the direct debit mandate, the club will contact you to arrange the most suitable day of the month for collection.
