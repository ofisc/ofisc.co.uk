Figure Club is holding a Spin Spiral Jump competition from 4:30pm until 6pm on Saturday 19 November at the Oxford Ice Rink.

This is a fun and easy competition that provides a gentle introduction to figure skating as a performance sport.

Appropriate music for each skater in the Spin Spiral Jump will be set by the team on the day.

It will be judged by a panel, so that skaters get the feeling of how a competition runs. There will also be a prize ceremony at the end, which the jduges feed into. But it's all very friendly, so don't be put off by skating in front of judges.

There is no minimum level for the Spin Spiral Jump competition but you will need your own skates and you will need a private coach to help you put a routine together. This will not require a huge amount of private coaching, it is simply to provide the skater with some orientation before they take the ice on the day.

## Competition Categories

There are two categories for the competition:

* Spin Spiral Jump - aimed at first time competitors who have not practiced their own routine. We will supply music for you to skate to.
* Beginner - aimed at skaters who have passed Skate UK Gold but have not completed Beginner level and have practised their own routine. You will need to bring a CD with your music to the competition.

## Entry Fee

Entry fee for the competition is £15.

The fee for Figure Club skaters is collected by direct debit, so no action is required by club members.

Non-club members can pay the fee directly to the club using the payment button below.
