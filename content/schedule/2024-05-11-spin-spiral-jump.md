OFISC is holding a Spin Spiral Jump competition from 4:30pm until 7pm on Saturday 11 May at Oxford Ice Rink.
This is a fun competition that provides a gentle introduction to figure skating as a performance sport.

# Eligibility
The competition is open to any skater who trains at the Oxford rink on a first come, first served basis.

# Competition Categories
There are three categories for the competition:
+ **Spin Spiral Jump (SSJ)** - aimed at competitors who do not yet have a competition programme routine, but do have a coach. We will supply music for you to skate to.
+ **Pre-Beginner Programme Competition** - aimed at skaters who have passed Skate UK Gold and have begun to practice their own routine in preparation for an open competition. You will need to supply your own music for the competition.
+ **Beginner+ Programme Competition** - aimed at skaters who have already competed in an open (official) competition. There will be separate sections for Beginner and National Level 1 skaters. You will need to supply your own music for the competition.

# Judging
The event will be judged by a panel so that skaters get the feeling of how a competition runs. There will also be a prize ceremony at the end. It's all very friendly and a great opportunity to get some experience.
+ **SSJ Category** - There is no minimum level for the SSJ competition, but you will need your own skates and a private coach to help you put a short routine together. This will not require a huge amount of private coaching, it is simply to provide the skater with some orientation before they take to the ice on the day. Appropriate music will be set by the team for each skater on the day.
+ **Pre-Beginner and Beginner+ Programme Categories** - The programme categories will be judged by a panel of three older, experienced skaters, which means you can use your score as a feedback leading up to official competitions. Feedback and medals will be awarded per section. Please note that you won't be able to claim this score, but it will provide an indication of a potential official competition score.

# Entry Fee
The entry fee for all categories is Â£15 per skater.
The fee for Figure Club skaters is collected by direct debit, so no action is required by OFISC members.
Non-OFISC members can pay the fee directly to the club by bank transfer:

# Music
