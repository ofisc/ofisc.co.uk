Figure Club is planning to hold a Spin Spiral Jump competition. Provisionally booked for the afternoon of Saturday 11 May 2024 at Oxford Ice Rink.

This is a fun and easy competition that provides a gentle introduction to figure skating as a performance sport.

Appropriate music for each skater in the Spin Spiral Jump will be set by the team on the day.

It will be judged by a panel, so that skaters get the feeling of how a competition runs. There will also be a prize ceremony at the end, which the jduges feed into. But it's all very friendly, so don't be put off by skating in front of judges.

There is no minimum level for the Spin Spiral Jump competition but you will need your own skates and you will need a private coach to help you put a routine together. This will not require a huge amount of private coaching, it is simply to provide the skater with some orientation before they take the ice on the day.
